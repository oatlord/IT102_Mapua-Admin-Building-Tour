These are the auditoriums!
Previously one big auditorium, we have opted to use the large space to create more dynamic classrooms for student perusal.
These auditorium classrooms are so large, you could fit three entire classes inside!
How marvelous!
With that, our journey comes to an end. Thank you, dear friend, for letting this old man stretch his legs again and show you the beauty of Mapua Malayan Colleges.
I do sincerely hope you enjoyed your experience.
Why not share how your tour has been so far? 
Head over to the stairs to the left to end the tour.
Hoho, I hope to be seeing you again soon, dear friend!
Farewell!
